This is the setup in AWS and GitHub to run tests

1. Created an AWS user  with the IAM in conf/iam.json

2. Cerates a ssh key, imported as a public key as nuvolaris-key in the defaults zone.
The private key is encoded as base64 in ID_RSA_B64

3. wrore an env.src with those secrets

export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=
export ID_RSA_B64=

4. Created those values as GitHub secrets

5. Creates zones in Route53 to be updated by the updateZone.sh script

6. also you need  an env-adm.src with access key with more power and be able to create EKS clusters
